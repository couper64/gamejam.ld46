Stats
=====
Rule: Each mini-game must correspond to a stat you want to raise/maintain.
Some can be time-based.

Core Stats:
-----------
- Hunger
  > Feed the baby some food. Baby mouth closes and open at random intervals. You got to
  time it right and put the food in the baby's mouth. The spoon shakes as well (as extra
  challenge). Failed to put it in baby gets upset. Time-based and bar-fill.
  
- Thirst
  > Some sliders to adjust the heat. Click finish to stop it at the right temperature. Need to get it just right.
  
- Cleanliness
  > Use your mouth to scrub the baby. Time-based and points-based. Higher the point, higher the cleanliness will go up.
  
- Toilet
  > ???
- Gas (Burping)
  > Hit the baby not too hard but not too soft. Strength-check like mini-game.
- Boredom
  > Keep selecting the right toys to give to the baby. Some toys give higher points. Time-based
